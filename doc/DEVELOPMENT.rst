Introduction
------------

This document contains some important tips on compiling and developing for
specific platforms.

Compiling The Source
--------------------

Basic Build Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Python >= 3.5
-  meson >= 0.48.0 (build system; >=0.49.0 recommended)
-  docutils


To build and install Taisei on \*nix, just follow these steps:

::

    cd /path/to/taisei/source
    mkdir build
    cd build
    meson --prefix=$yourprefix ..
    ninja
    ninja install

This will install game data to ``$prefix/share/taisei/`` and build this
path *statically* into the executable. This might be a package
maintainerâ€™s choice. Alternatively you may want to add
``-Dinstall_relative=true`` to get a relative structure like

::

    $prefix/taisei
    $prefix/data/

``install_relative`` is always set when building for Windows.


OpenGL ES Support (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OpenGL ES 3.0 backend is not built by default. To enable it, do:

::

    meson configure -Dr_gles30=true -Dshader_transpiler=true

See `here <doc/ENVIRON.rst>`__ on how to manually activate it.

To set OpenGL ES 3.0 as the *default* renderer, do:

::

    meson configure -Dr_default=gles30

The OpenGL ES 2.0 backend can be enabled similarly, using ``gles20`` instead of
``gles30``. However, it requires a few extensions to function correctly, most
notably:

- ``OES_depth_texture`` or ``GL_ANGLE_depth_texture``
- ``OES_standard_derivatives``
- ``OES_vertex_array_object``
- ``EXT_frag_depth``
- ``EXT_instanced_arrays`` or ``ANGLE_instanced_arrays`` or
  ``NV_instanced_arrays``

For Windows and macOS, you will need Google's ANGLE library for both ES 3.0 and
2.0. You'll need to check out
`ANGLE <https://github.com/google/angle>`__ and build it first. Refer to their
documentation on how to do that.

Once you've compiled ANGLE, enable it with:

::

    meson -Dinstall_angle=true -Dangle_libegl=/path/to/libEGL.{dll,dylib}
    -Dangle_libgles=/path/to/libGLESv2.{dll,dylib}

Ensure you use the correct file extension for your platform. (``.dll`` for
Windows, ``.dylib`` for macOS.)

It'll install automatically with ``ninja install`` (as mentioned above).

Development
-----------

Build Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can enable debugging options/output for development purposes:

::

    meson configure -Dbuildtype=debug -Db_ndebug=false


This option also helps for speeding up build times:

::

    meson configure -Db_lto=false


For debugging actual gameplay, you can set this option and it will enable cheats
and other 'fast-forward' options by the pressing keys defined in
``src/config.h``.

::

    meson configure -Ddeveloper=true


Coding Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ``*.c`` files, tabs are used. In the ``meson.build`` and ``*.py`` files, spaces
are used.

To help you abide by this standard, you should install
`EditorConfig <https://github.com/editorconfig>`__ for your preferred editor of
choice, and load in the file found at ``.editorconfig`` in the root of the
project.


Platform-Specific Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows
"""""""

TODO: complete this section.

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
"""""""""""""""""""""

On an apt-based system (Debian/Ubuntu), ensure you have build dependencies
installed:

::

    apt-get install meson cmake build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libogg-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libzip-dev libx11-dev libwayland-dev


macOS
"""""

Manual
~~~~~

On macOS, you need to begin with installing the Xcode Command Line Tools:

::

    xcode-select --install

There are additional command line tools that you'll need. You can acquire those
by using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.

Follow the instructions for installing Homebrew, and then install the following
tools:

::

    brew install meson cmake pkg-config docutils imagemagick pygments python3


The following dependencies are technically optional, and can be pulled in at
build-time, but you're better off installing them yourself to reduce compile
times:

::

    brew install freetype2 libzip opusfile libvorbis webp sdl2


You'll also want to set the following environment variables on your shell's
.zshrc or .bash_profile:

::

   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"


As of 2020-02-18, you should **not** install the following packages via
Homebrew, as the versions available do not compile against Taisei correctly.
If you're having mysterious errors, ensure that they're not installed.

* ``spirv-tools``
* ``spirv-cross``
* ``sdl2_mixer``

Remove them with:

::

    brew remove spirv-tools spirv-cross sdl2_mixer


Taisei-compatible versions will be pulled in at compile time.

In addition, if you're trying to compile on an older version of macOS
(e.x: <10.12), SDL2 may not compile correctly on Homebrew (as of 2019-02-19).
Let ``meson`` pull in the corrected version for you via subprojects.


Automatic
~~~~~~~~~

To do the above steps automatically, run ``scripts/macos-deps-install.sh``.

Graphical Assets
----------------

Taisei's GFX library is made up of a collection of sprites, shaders, and a few
3D models. The 3D models are exclusively used for background scenery, while the
sprites are used in everything from UI elements, to character portraits, to the
danmaku bullets themselves.

To modify the 3D models, you'll need `Blender <https://blender.org>`__, which is
free and open source. Look for tutorials on YouTube for how to use it. The
models themselves are located in ``resources/00-taisei.pkgdir/models``.

Music and sound effects are located in ``resources/00-taisei.pkgdir/sfx``.

For sprites, any image editor will do. Sprites are locaed in ``atlas``, in
``.png`` format. However, to have sprites properly appear in Taisei, you'll
need a few packages and tools first to rebuild the atlas so the game can load
them properly.

You'll need ``rectpack`` and ``pillow`` from ``Python PIP``:

::

    pip3 install rectpack pillow

You'll also need to download (and/or compile) and install
`Leanify <https://github.com/JayXon/Leanify>`__.

Run the following command from the root directory, once your sprites are
modified:

::

    ninja gen-atlas-common_ui

That will regenerate the files needed for your new sprites to appear correctly.
